        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
        <p>This is Ntokozo and here I will be creating an open-source Expert Advisor which will be available for public usage regardless of your location etc.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, I will need help from willing developers publicly to contribute to our project of building an Expert Advisor which can be both reliable and easy to use for everyone. Thus meaning our project will be open-source and anyone can contribute to it and the source code is available for anyone to use on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ntokozodeveloper/themonsterea">Github</a>
                       </p>
        <p>The Monster Expert Advisor is built on the following technologies:</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h3><strong>Nodejs:</strong></h3>
                        <p>The Monster Expert Advisor is built on Nodejs, which is the backend of the Expert Advisor and executes trades, analyzes the market, and handles user inputs such as "account numbers", "passwords" and "API keys".</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h2><strong>Reactjs:</strong></h2>
                        <p>The Monster Expert Advisor uses Reactjs as its Frontend Interface and user inputs entered here (Website) are sent to the Nodejs Backend server for processing and analysis. The results are then displayed on the website.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h2><strong>Python:</strong></h2>
                        <p>The Monster Expert Advisor uses Python to fetch historical market data from different sources, combine that data, calculate the "probability" for that trade, recommend lot size, and generate signals.</p>
